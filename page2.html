    <br> <h1 class="weapons">Weapons</h2>
There are several diffrent types of weapons. a list of them would be, Auto rifles, scout rifles, pulse rifles, SMGs, sidearms, hand cannons, bows, shotguns, sniper rifles, fusion rifles, linear fusion rifles, grenade launchers, rocket luanchers, and swords. 

<h2 class="weapons"> Auto Rifles</h2>
<img src="http://qtoptens.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Misfit_Destiny_2.jpg" alt="an auto rifle" height="150">
Auto rifles are a very basic weapon type, they are just assult rifles from any other game put simply. they shoot full auto but there are many diffrent types of auto rifles, such as some that shoot slower or faster than others. They often have fairly good stats over all but are often lacking in range or stability. Allthough the slower fireing autos dont have this problem.


<h2 class="weapons">Scout Rifles </h2>
<img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/destinypedia/images/7/7f/D2-Transfiguration.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20180918014742" alt="Scout rifle" height="150">
Scout rifles are some slower shooting weapons than others. They shoot fairly slow and have massive range and some very good damage over ranges. Some shoot faster, and are good at medium ranges. Others would shoot slower and deal massive damage over range.

<h2 class="weapons"> Pulse rifles</h2>
<img src="http://qtoptens.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BlastFurnace.jpg" alt="pulse rifle" height="150">
Pulse rifles shoot bursts of bullets on a trigger pull, they have great damage at medium range, some of them even function well at long range. They shoot bursts of 2-8 with the average pulse rifle shoooting 4 or 5 a burst. 


<h2 class="weapons">Sub machine guns </h2>

Smgs are a pretty good type of weapon. They shoot extreemly fast and can deal good damage at close ranges. 


<h2 class="weapons">Sidearms </h2>
<img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/destinypedia/images/5/59/Last_Hope_Screenshot.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170908095429" alt="burst sidearm" height="150">
<img src="https://bungie.net/common/destiny2_content/screenshots/1843044398.jpg" alt="normal sidearm" height="150">
There are two diffrent types of sidearms, normal side arms that fire one shot on a trigger pull, and burst sidearms that fire 2-3 shots on a trigger pull. Both function well at close ranges. They can be very useful if paired with a long range weapon and are meant to be backup weapons for if you run out of ammo on another of your weapons or need a close range gun for a moment. 

<h2 class="weapons"> Handcannons</h2>
<img src="https://bungie.net/common/destiny2_content/screenshots/4077196130.jpg" alt="Hand cannon" height="150">
Hand cannons are one of the more popular weapon types. They function best in close to medium ranges are fire at a moderate speed, doing good damage in one bullet. They are some of the best primary weapons because it does not take much to defeat someone with. They are fairly grouped with how fast they fire going from moderate to slow, the faster fireing ones are usualy better because you have a little bit less downtime between shots. However the fastest hand cannons dont have a lot of range, so they are not used in as many situations as a normal hand cannon would be. The slower they fire the more recoil they have. 

<h2 class="weapons"> Bows</h2>
<img src="https://bungie.net/common/destiny2_content/screenshots/720351795.jpg" alt="bow" height="150">
Bows are a newer type of weapon and there are very few of them. They function at long and medium range and are great percision weapons because you can steady your shot then fire. They do very well in a situation where you need to take down a bigger target or are in pvp. 

<h2 class="weapons"> Shotguns</h2>
<img src="https://d1fs8ljxwyzba6.cloudfront.net/assets/editorial/2019/08/how-to-get-the-mindbenders-ambition-in-destiny-2.jpg" alt=" normal shotgun" height="150">
<img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/destinypedia/images/e/ec/Good_Bone_Structure_Screenshot.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170908095833" alt="slug shotgun" height="150">
Shotguns take special ammo so you do not always have ammo for them, unlike everything else that has been talked about so far. Tere are two types of shotguns, slug shotguns that have very good range for a shotgun and shoot one bullet and normal shotguns that function how you would expect them to. they shoot a bunch of pellets and have very shoot range but do massive damage at that short range. Some shotguns can shoot extreemly fast in full auto, these are best in pve. There are of corse diffrent shotguns that shoot at diffrent speeds.

<h2 class="weapons"> Snipers</h2>
<img src="https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny2_content/screenshots/686951703.jpg" alt="Sniper rifle" height="150">
Snipers are some of the most rewarding weapons in the game, high damage at any range. The catch is that they take someone with a very good aim to land a hit. in crucible you can one shot to the head, and in pve you can deal great damage to anything. they take special ammo. Some snipers such as high impact snipers will deal much larger ammounts of damage, but at the cost of rate of fire. The rapid fire snipers are poplar in crucible because you can quickly doubble body shot someone.

<h2 class="weapons"> Fusion rifles</h2>
<img src="https://bungie.net/common/destiny2_content/screenshots/3027844941.jpg" alt="fsion rifle" height="150">
Fusion rifles are a very interesting type of weapon. They shoot multiple pellets like a shotgun does, but they have to charge up before they can fire. They function best in ranges in between a sniper and shotgun but can preform good in both. The high impact fusion rifles are widly regarded as the best because they have amazing range and damage. they take special ammo.

<h2 class="weapons">Linear fusion rifles </h2>
<img src="https://d1lss44hh2trtw.cloudfront.net/assets/article/2018/05/30/tarantula-destiny-2_feature.jpg" alt="Linear fusion rifle" height="150">
These are very similar to fusion rifles but they shoot a single shot, with charge up time. They deal huge ammounts of damage, and take poer/heavy ammo.

<h2 class="weapons"> Grenade Launchers</h2>
<img src="https://d1lss44hh2trtw.cloudfront.net/assets/article/2019/06/24/best-grenade-launchers-in-destiny-2_feature.jpg" alt="grenade launcher" height="150"> <img src="https://bungie.net/common/destiny2_content/screenshots/3745974521.jpg" alt="special grenade launcher" height="150">
Grenade launchers are very powerful eavy weapons that fire one shot at a time at a somewhat slow rate of fire. Some of corse can fire faster than others. The best part of theese is if you have the perk spike grendaes, your direct hit damage goes up by %10 making your weapon one of the highest damage dealing weapons out there. They take power ammo.
There can also be special ammo grenade launchers that shoot one sho at a time, they can also be verry powerful.
<h2 class="weapons">Rocket launchers </h2>
<img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3T37pJ5xnx-5N8z37uVkWst3qyc=/0x0:1920x1080/1200x800/filters:focal(807x387:1113x693)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/63156445/Destiny_2_Screenshot_2019.03.01___11.18.43.91.0.png" alt="rocket launcher" height="150">
Rocket launchers can be very popular in any activity for their high damage. they shoot one shot at a time at a fairly slow fire rate. sometimes they can even trakc or do a massive explosion on impact. they take power/heavy ammo.



<h2 class="weapons">Swords </h2>
<img src="https://bungie.net/common/destiny2_content/screenshots/715338174.jpg" alt="sword" height="150">
Swords are a strange weapon type, they take heavy amoo and operate in extreemly close ranges. There are some activities where a sword will be amazing but they are usualy not that great. they can however inflict massive damage on a single target. 



<h2 class="exotic">Exotic weapons</h2>
<img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/destinypedia/images/0/03/Tractor_Cannon_Screenshot.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170908094951" alt="exotic weapon tractor cannon" height="150">
There are many exotic weapons that function diffrently from a normal weapon. There are way to many to talk about so I wont go into detail, an example of one would be an auto rifle that shoots out of 4 barrels at once. or an auto rifle that changes the way it fires if you shoot longer or aim down sigts.
The image above is tractor cannon, a heavy shotgun that will deal a fair ammount of damage, but make the enemy hit by it vunerable to extra damage from your teammates.
